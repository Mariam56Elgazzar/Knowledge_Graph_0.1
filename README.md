## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Data2Dash/Data2Dash-ai.git
cd Data2Dash-ai/ai/knowledge_graph
2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Add Environment Variables
Create a .env file:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional
NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
4️⃣ Run the app
streamlit run main.py
Open:

http://localhost:8501
🔎 GraphRAG Querying
After generating the knowledge graph, you can ask:

“What dataset was the model trained on?”
“Which method outperformed the baseline?”

The system retrieves relevant chunks, expands graph context, and produces grounded answers with evidence.
